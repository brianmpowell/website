<h3>Inequality in the NBA draft</h3>
<p>Inspired by research investigating institutional inequality in academic publishing and hiring, I wrote a <a href="https://txtlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unlevel_Fields_2020.pdf">report</a> on the distribution of U.S. colleges in the NBA draft. I discovered that the proportion of picks from the top 10 schools has steadily increased since the one-and-done rule came into effect in 2006. I also investigated if attending a blue blood translates to higher performance at the professional level. The short answer is that it may matter somewhat, but not for the most talented players.</p>

<h3>Shiny App to Randomize Movie Selection</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, I soon realized I’d be watching more movies than usual. To make the selection process easier, I developed a simple Shiny app to narrow down a list of 100 bucket list films to 3 options based on streaming service and release date. Here’s the (possibly broken) <a href="https://brian-powell.shinyapps.io/top100movies/">link</a>.</p>

<h3>Bob Dylan: Nobel Prize-Winning Poet</h3>
<p>Bob Dylan was a surprise (and controversial) pick for the 2016 Nobel Prize in literature. After scraping all his lyrics, I compared their word frequency distributions to those of other prize-winning poets, including fellow laureates Yeats, Eliot, and Heaney, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGxjIBEZvx0">Dylan’s pal</a> Allen Ginsberg. Turns out “Visions of Johanna” and “Desolation Row” hold their own among 20C verse, however most of Dylan’s diction differs from traditional poetic lexicon. (I’ll blame his 80’s output, especially <a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/everything-broken/">this</a>.) The analysis can be found <a href="https://brianmpowell.com/Dylan_Poetry_Paper.pdf">here</a>.</p>
