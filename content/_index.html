<p>I’m a second year Statistics Master’s student at <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu">Stanford</a>. I studied math and CS during my undergrad at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/about-us">McGill</a>, where I was a research assistant at <a href="https://txtlab.org">.txtLAB@McGill</a>.</p>
<p>At .txtLAB, I applied data science techniques to study everything from topic probabilities in humanities journals to <a href="https://txtlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unlevel_Fields_2020.pdf">inequality in the NBA draft</a>.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer and ultimate frisbee, supporting Liverpool FC, and listening to jazz music.</p>
